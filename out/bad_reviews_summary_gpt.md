### Key Insights and Suggestions for Developers Based on Bad Reviews

The reviews of the game reveal a host of issues across gameplay, monetization, optimization, and general user experience. Below are detailed insights and possible avenues for improvement:

---

## 1. **Gameplay Mechanics: Lack of Responsiveness, AI Manipulation, and Perceived "Scripting"**
   Many players are frustrated with the in-game experience, particularly the mechanics that feel unfair, inconsistent, or outright "manipulated." Common issues include:
   - **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) or "Scripting":** Players feel that outcomes are artificially determined to drive monetary engagement in modes like Ultimate Team. Examples include:
     - AI inexplicably outperforming human players (e.g., low-rated defenders outrunning high-rated attackers).
     - Predictable match outcomes based on perceived AI intervention or “cheating.”
   - **Unresponsive Player Controls:**
     - Commands during crucial moments, such as shooting or passing, frequently result in unintended actions (e.g., passes going in the wrong direction, inability to switch defenders manually).
     - Defenders standing idle or giving penalties without player input leads to further frustration.
     - AI-controlled opponents making unrealistically precise movements or fouls that aren't penalized.
   - **Break in Immersion:**
     - Unnatural opponent behavior, such as retreating to their keeper when trailing late in matches.
     - Over-the-top events that feel “programmed” rather than skill-based (e.g., absurdly effective goalkeepers or defenders seeming to "teleport").

   **Suggested Actions:**
   - Address AI behavior to make matches feel fair and balanced. Players want skill-based outcomes, not results determined by "invisible forces."
   - Provide **transparency** about game mechanics (e.g., any implemented difficulty adjustment algorithms). If DDA is used, test if its impact can be toned down or limited to specific game modes.
   - Improve responsiveness and input accuracy for player controls, especially during critical moments.
   - Test edge cases where the AI behavior breaks immersion (e.g., irrational decisions like unnecessary back-passing in losing scenarios).

## 2. **Monetization Criticisms: Pay-to-Win and Predatory Loot Boxes**
   Players are highly critical of the monetization strategy employed, particularly in Ultimate Team (UT). Complaints suggest the game feels more like a “casino” than a football simulation:
   - **Pay-to-Win Mechanics:**
     - Player success depends heavily on purchasing loot boxes or packs, especially in UT mode.
     - Skill feels secondary to the depth of a user's wallet, alienating non-spending or low-spending players.
   - **Loot Boxes as RNG Gambling:** 
     - The randomized reward system feels exploitative, particularly given the game’s appeal to younger audiences.
     - Scenarios where substantial purchases still yield poor rewards exacerbate the frustration.
   - Ethical concerns are raised repeatedly about targeting children with psychologically manipulative systems.

   **Suggested Actions:**
   - Reconsider monetization models, incorporating **non-pay-to-win options** to reward skill rather than spending (e.g., allowing players to grind for top-tier items or players).
   - Provide **greater transparency** about loot box mechanics (e.g., drop rates).
   - Introduce alternative modes for players who don’t want to participate in the monetized ecosystem.
   - Consider offering a “Base Mode” for Ultimate Team, stripped of paid advantages, to provide a skill-focused experience.

## 3. **Lack of Innovation and Recycled Features**
   Players report that recent iterations of the game feel like reskins of previous versions, with minimal meaningful improvements:
   - **Identical UI and Menus:** The interface feels unpolished and recycled. Simplified menu designs in certain modes (e.g., Manager Mode) also detract from the experience.
   - **Recycled Issues and Bugs:** Long-standing issues in gameplay, freezing, crashing, and servers remain unfixed.
   - **Minimal and Superficial Improvements:** While rare players admitted to minor improvements (e.g., better ball control or Rush mode), most perceive the game as stagnating.
   - Players see EA’s yearly release cycle as primarily money-driven without offering genuine innovation.

   **Suggested Actions:**
   - **Redesign the UI:** Invest resources into creating a fresh, intuitive, and user-friendly interface for modes like Manager Mode and main menus.
   - **Emphasize real improvements:** Clearly communicate meaningful gameplay or graphical enhancements in marketing campaigns.
   - Reinforce testing to improve **bug fixing** and reduce crashes/freezing.
   - If significant changes aren't possible yearly, consider moving to a **live-service model** (e.g., a single base game with seasonal updates) rather than releasing what players feel are near-identical annual versions.

## 4. **Optimization Issues (Particularly for PC)**
   Many PC players report issues with optimization:
   - **Laggy Input and Servers:** Online gameplay suffers from severe lag, leading to unplayable matches on unreliable servers.
   - **Poor PC Optimization and Perpetual Bugs:** Reviews highlight consistent freezing, crashes, or performance problems that remain unresolved despite large-scale forum discussions. 
   - Players purchasing the game on PC feel overlooked compared to console users.
   - Significant dissatisfaction with the value of paying full price for a game that doesn’t function properly.

   **Suggested Actions:**
   - Allocate dedicated resources to PC optimization testing and troubleshooting. Performance differences between platforms should be addressed.
   - Improve server infrastructure to reduce online lag and provide smoother input responses.
   - Actively engage with the player community (e.g., forums) to resolve widespread and persistent technical issues. Transparency about planned fixes can restore goodwill.

## 5. **Negative Value Perception**
   Many players feel the game doesn’t justify its price:
   - Considering the minimal upgrades, bugs, poor optimization, and reliance on microtransactions, users feel the game lacks value unless bought at a heavy discount.
   - Angry customers even request **refunds** (e.g., €70 in one review) for not being able to play a smooth game two weeks post-purchase.
   - Long-time players who have stuck with the franchise for years see this version as the “worst yet.”

   **Suggested Actions:**
   - Adjust pricing models based on comprehensive quality evaluations. If a game is released with major performance or balancing issues, discounts or compensations for affected players may soften the backlash.
   - Shift toward a **sustainable live-service model** (e.g., offering updates akin to software patches) to lower costs for loyal players while gradually refining mechanics.
   - Offer goodwill gestures to customers frustrated by broken releases, such as free bonus content, in-game currency, or partial refunds.

## Summary of Key Concerns:
- **Gameplay Issues:** Unfair and unresponsive mechanics with overt AI manipulation.
- **Monetization Criticism:** Overwhelming “pay-to-win” culture with predatory loot boxes exploiting vulnerable demographics.
- **Recycled Content:** Players perceive little effort beyond reskinning previous editions.
- **Optimization Problems:** Persistent lag, crashes, and poor PC performance damage user experience.
- **Price vs. Value:** Poor quality at launch doesn't justify the high retail price, leaving players feeling exploited.

## Suggested Developer Focus in Future Iterations:
1. Prioritize **fairness and skill-based gameplay** by reevaluating AI balance and removing/reducing manipulative mechanics (such as scripting/DDA).
2. Overhaul **monetization models** to make them more ethical and less alienating for low/no-spend players.
3. Invest in **UI/UX design refresher** to prevent the game from feeling repetitive and stale.
4. Dedicate resources to **PC optimization and server reliability**.
5. Focus on building **long-term goodwill** with the community by delivering polished, genuine improvements and addressing long-standing complaints.

By addressing these criticisms, developers can rebuild trust in the fanbase, reduce backlash, and create a game that feels fun, fair, and rewarding.
