Recommendation,Review
Not Recommended,"TL:DR - This game is a psychologically manipulative Skinner box. It is designed to be addictive, and to get as much money out of you as possible. Scripting, implemented to encourage FUT players to spend more money, is in every mode and makes every game an unsatisfying and empty experience. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, the income-focused manipulation displayed here is repugnant. DDA (dynamic difficulty adjustment) or scipting is just ridiculous now. In games against EA's garbage AI, if the game wants your opponent to score, they'll respond to your controller inputs instantly, not the actions of the player you're controlling. Easy tackles with world class defenders will either miss, bounce the ball to another opponent, just outright phase through the ball or even the damn player! Your keeper will do a Matrix-esque dodge of a shot coming directly at them or will spill an easy catch directly into their striker. The most outrageous though, is player switching on loose balls and when contesting headers. The game will sometimes prevent you from switching to a player (even manually with the right stick) if they're close enough to win a loose ball or are in the best position to win a header. They will instead just stand there, staring blankly into the distance, until the opponent wins back possession. It's the most obvious example of the game cheating to achieve the outcome it wants. This stuff is so obvious that I've been able to predict when a goal is coming, just by how many advantages the AI gets. Other examples: - 30 year old fullback with 60 pace will gain an otherworldly burst of speed to get ahead of my winger with 90 pace - Players will frequently and deliberately place themselves in a position to lose headers, even if you're instructing them to do the opposite - Opposition defenders will basically teleport to tackle you the second you press shoot in the box - Your passes will frequently go to a player in the complete opposite direction to the one you've commanded - Uncontrolled defenders will randomly clatter someone in the box, giving away a penalty - Some of the AI's most outrageous Sunday league fouls just won't be given - If the game doesn't want you to score anymore (or has the scoreline it wants to achieve), the opposition will just pass the ball around the back or run all the way back to the keeper upon any pressure. This would be fine if they weren't 2-1 down at 70', where any team would be pushing hard for an equaliser. Again, just breaks the immersion. - If the game wants you to score, all of these advantages are removed and opposing players lose 50 IQ points. It's ridiculously transparent. These problems extend to all other game modes, especially Ultimate Team. At the end of the day, all this does is damage the experience. Wins don't feel earned, since it's obvious that the game is allowing you to win. When you lose it's often because of the above advantages, not from been legitimately outplayed. For a game that aims to recreate football, it fails spectacularly in presenting the core part of that experience; the in-match gameplay. Neglecting this, by adding a scripting or variable difficulty system to psychologically manipulate FUT players to spend more money, not only irrevocably destroys the experience in all modes, but is also outrageously anti-consumer. I knew on reputation that EA Sports games were microtransaction ridden hellholes but this is predatory to a degree I've never seen before. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, manipulation like this is repugnant. Honestly, I feel dirty having spent money on this. Do not buy this or any other EA Sports Skinner box, it's a prime example of everything wrong with this heinous company."
Not Recommended,"Worst Fifa ever, terrible passing, shooting, lag input, servers are so laggy. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!"
Not Recommended,"‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• gameplay, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• servers, full of bugs and problems. Buying this garbage game is just a way to destroy your nerves."
Not Recommended,"Year after year EA finds ways to make the game worse, especially for the PC players. Would not recommend getting it even on sales, feel sorry for those who paid the full price. Make this game free to play already, 0/10"
Not Recommended,"I purchased this game 2 weeks ago and I still was not able to play a single smooth game because of the terrible otimization this game has and not only for me but multiple PC players, there is a whole EA forum dedicated to this error with over 300 pages and EA didn't give a damn about it and most likely wont fix. Its a completly incompetent company that doesn't care about their own playerbase, the minimum they could do is refund 70‚Ç¨ to all the users wich have been having this problem for over a whole month."
Not Recommended,"Even iPhone 16 got a bigger upgrade than the FC 25 but here are some things you should know before buying: 1, The game itself is not bad, better control, and no more feeling like you're skiing on grass. 2, Thousands of tiny, funny bugs, but it won't ruin your day.... mostly. 3, Surprisingly the Rush mode is pretty funny. 4, many new ideas for manager mode but the disgusting simplified UI is so bad to use (my opinion). 5, Prematch animation is back. Unless you play UT mode, DON'T BUY THIS GAME NOW! There are so many bugs! Wait for Black Friday or Christmas‚Äîyour wallet will THANK YOU. It's not worth paying full price just to fill EA's bottomless pit of greed!"
Not Recommended,"As an avid fan of the franchise, it pains me to write this review for FC 25, which has delivered an immensely disappointing and frustrating experience. The most glaring issue is the abysmal gameplay balance, which feels more like a step backward than an improvement. Matches are too often decided by glaring AI inconsistencies, making even basic mechanics feel random and unreliable. It‚Äôs genuinely astonishing how unrefined the game feels after years of supposed advancements. Moreover, it's hard to ignore the evident lack of regard from EA for the game's current state. Community feedback seems disregarded entirely, with players voicing frustrations about bugs, balancing issues, and broken mechanics that have yet to be addressed. While cosmetic updates and monetization strategies are regularly prioritized, essential gameplay fixes are blatantly neglected, leaving the core experience in a poor state. In its current form, FC 25 feels less like a polished soccer simulation and more like a cash grab, relying on fans‚Äô loyalty without showing any commitment to improving the player experience. For a company as established as EA, it‚Äôs disappointing to see the community treated with such disregard, and the product itself left in such a poor state."
Not Recommended,"Started as a football game, ended up running a digital casino where my team‚Äôs success depended on how deep my wallet was. My best tactic? Praying to EA‚Äôs loot box gods. ‚ÄúPay-to-Winchester,‚Äù ‚ÄúCredit Card FC,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMicrotransaction United‚Äù were my top clubs. 2/10 would rather play actual football in my backyard. üí∏üé∞‚öΩ Follow my curator page for more wallet-draining disasters, RNG heartbreaks, and games where skill loses to spending! üí∏üéÆ‚ú®"
Not Recommended,"Same menu as ea fc 24 and same bugs as ea fc 24. Same freezes, same crashes. I love football but i only bought this cause of no competiton. One good football game and this company is gone. Pls make that happen. They dont deserve our money, they dont deserve a single minute of our time!"
Not Recommended,"This is the worst, most pathetic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• dumpster fire game ever ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out by any developer. In every aspect. Game play is slow and clunky no matter what you do with the sliders. Your players cant sprint. It's like the game completely ignores your sprint inputs more than half the time. As the difficulty increases the opposing AI doesn't get better, YOUR OWN TEAM GETS WORSE. More and more passes get misplaced, more tackles get missed and positioning ends up looking like a squad of lazy kids who have never kicked a football in their life. Also the UI a terrible unorganized redundant puddle of cat piss. The bar with FC 24 was already low, and somehow this installment is worse in every single aspect."
Not Recommended,"EA Sports FC 25 is an absolute letdown. After all the hype about breaking away from FIFA, I expected something fresh‚Äîsomething bold but nope! It‚Äôs the same old game with a new name slapped on the cover. The gameplay is still clunky, Career Mode is as boring as ever, and Ultimate Team is just a shameless cash grab, pushing microtransactions like they're going out of style. It‚Äôs like EA didn‚Äôt even try! The visuals barely improved, and the commentary makes me want to mute the game altogether. Honestly, if this is what EA thinks a ""new era"" looks like, they can keep it‚Äîbecause this is just FIFA 24.5 with extra disappointment."
Not Recommended,"I have never posted a review ever in my life. HOWEVER, the GARBAGE, BROKEN, and UNPLAYABLE nature of this game has prompted this review. I have played every FIFA/EA game since 2014 and have had seen some good games and mediocre ones. However, I thought that EAFC 24 was the worst in the entire series...UNTIL THIS GAME. At launch, clubs was unplayable. Every patch promised fixes, but with every update a million and one more bugs, crashes, and exploits appeared. Ultimate team is not any better, with constant crashes and unbalanced matchmaking. And now at the end of its life, the devs have become money hungry and have even added a paid version of the battle pass. At this point, it is literally unplayable with bots and AI directly disobeying commands and tactics. If you enjoy the series, do yourself a favor and wait for the next iteration. This is NOT WORTH IT."
Not Recommended,Bugs bugs bugs... so many I can only assume they are too lazy or neglectful to fix it. They only care about you spending your money on microtransactions
Not Recommended,This game is a downgrade every single year. It's unoptimized and the gameplay is so slow that it will make you fall asleep.
Not Recommended,Product refunded This game is actually amazing! It gives you a really outer body experience. You literally set low expectations and buy it for the sake of just playing FIFA after missing out on so many years.. and your body simply reacts automatically after you play for about 15 mins.. it just reacts and leads you to the refund page! Truly amazing. An outer body experience!
Not Recommended,"A buggy mess after latest patch. Players disappear from the field in second half. Goal replay shows players standing up straight like NPCs. Match ended and game get stuck at loading screen. Tried many things, clear cache restart new career mode and couple match later same crap happen. Never have major problems with this game or previous FIFA. I am so pissed that I have to make this review. Really pissed. Edit:- Game work for couple matches before the stuck at another loading screen after match. UNISTALLED THE GAME, BYE BYE EAFC25!!!!"
Not Recommended,"EA FC 25 offers the same gameplay as ever. However, the game quickly becomes an exhausting and frustrating experience. There is a constant need to grind to earn rewards during every event (which occurs every month) to keep your team updated and competitive. This turns the game into more of a chore than fun. The player's AI is horrible, leading to frustrating in-game experiences where your players constantly make inexplicable mistakes that leave you wondering how is it even happening."
Not Recommended,"The most trash game ever. Every single year, it's the same; in fact, it's worse. A lot of bugs and glitches‚Äîthe ball is always bouncing from the defender to the opponent's striker. Marcus Thuram is a god, even though he can't touch the ball in real life. The CDM position is useless since the AI doesn't even follow the ball. EA surprises us with a masterpiece every freaking year. Amazing job, EA."
Not Recommended,"This incredible piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, feels worse, looks worse and is just as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• as the last. Don't buy this overpriced ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. There's a better chance of diddy being innocent than EA making a good game. At least the last two were fun to play when high :("
Recommended,"far better than the last few titles; however, it is still an EA product. So, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price (the $70 price tag is simply outrageous for the amount of improvement this game has gotten since the last title). My suggestion for the possible buyer of this game is to wait until December, then buy the game during the winter sale at a fairly lower price."
Not Recommended,"game works perfect when released, then updates come in and start bugging and lagging my in game matches, PC EAFC25 is really poor"
Not Recommended,Worst purchase of my life. The game stutters and lags for no reason at all. I have a perfectly capable machine to run this game but still it is not running smooth. EA pay my money back!! I want my money!
Not Recommended,"Controller input is bugged, so can't play the game :)"
Not Recommended,Regretting purchasing for this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. Same game from last year but with idiot AI in simulation. There's bugs (as always) and the quality of the game is so low that it is not worthy considering the price.
Not Recommended,Horrible game. Billion dollar company. Does not even put 1 single tester to check the game before releasing and selling to hundreds of thousands of user. CONTROLLERS DO NOT WORK ON A GAME WHERE YOU PLAY FOOTBALL
Not Recommended,"This game is completely broken on pc. Controller doesnt work, constantly glitching in game which forces you to exit the game. Unbelievable that this game is allowed to launch when it's unplayable"
Not Recommended,"They just keep getting worse every year. The game launched in a decent state, but multiple patches has ruined any joy I used to have with this game. Please someone make a competitor so we don't have to deal with this trash ""simulator"" year after year."
Recommended,"If you're an Offline player like me who enjoys to play some Career modes then go for it, other than that Online modes are horrible as of today, this has the same release impact as FIFA 23, same problems. Career modes are fun and updated compared to last years game. It's only worth if you don't play Online much and when the price drop."
Not Recommended,"Pros -Musics Cons -Hackers -Sluggish gameplay -No anti cheat -There is a crossplay but the market is seperate so the cheaters extincts players in order to sell full price -mobile game looking menu -green time finishing which is utter gibberish -Pack weight is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. so the price of the players twice as much from consoles - Same promos with the same 13 player everytime. I am a returning player from Fifa 23 adn I am shocked that how can they ruined it even further. EA does not care about the players, the only thing they care is that their pockets."
Not Recommended,"ULTIMATE TEAM? Again and again and again EA just make this game worse and worse every year adding more and more arcade mechanics that EA don't know how to add that end up breaking the game in multiple ways. The defensive AI is absolutely busted, in high end games good luck getting a goal that isn't scrappy. EA have actually no idea what real football looks like this game is embarrassing, I'm embarrassed that I actually buy this game and expect something decent in 2025. FUT Champs. As good as rewards are this year is is actually so difficult to get through 20 games of the way people play this year with 5 at the back and high defensive ai. Do not forget that EA's servers are ran by hampsters. Gameplay in the first week of weekend league for me is actually so bad I went outside after 4 games. How can EA put no effort into servers on a game that makes them so much money? it actually blows my mind. PAY 2 WIN: Do not buy unless you feel like spending thousands of dollars trying to keep up with the meta to be competative, or wasting thousands of hours and still not getting the best players in the game. Rush is kind of fun but tbh 3/4 games all 3 of my team mates are mouth breathing ball hogs that dont know where the pass button is on their controller. Its a waste of 10 minutes half the time. BUT WHEN YOU DO GET A GOOD GAME its actually fun. Other than that I can say EA have made the gameplay a little better overall if you plan to play not competative or a game that isnt dependant on their servers like manager or career modes. Theres a lot that can be worked that EA probably wont even look at. One last thing SWITCHING. If no one is talking about this... they should be. Its broken and doesnt work properly. Has def caused me to lose some goals. Overall would give this game a 4/10 - REVIEW UPDATE: 2025-05-09 I have continued to waste my time in this game and EA has only made it worse. As a FIFA expert and one that has played this game since 2002. This is by FAR the worst FIFA EVER, call yourself what you want FC, EA FC, W.E. you have made this year EA is a pile of hot garbage."
Recommended,never touch ultimate team for your own mental health. Pro clubs and career mode are goated.
Recommended,"Hey guys if ur controller is not working go to Steam big picture mode and click on FC25, click on the controller icon and disable steam input. It worked for me (im using a ps4 controller) hope this helps."
Not Recommended,"if you are waiting to buy this game at a discount dont bother waiting. it isnt worth a single penny. worst game ive ever played. forget being the worst fifa game, its the worst game ive ever spent retail price for. ive been playing this franchise since 2012 and was already on the fence after fifa 23. i figured maybe fc25 might be a slight upgrade from fc24 but ive been massively disappointed. its the worst game in its entire franchise. this isnt me recommending you to not buy it, im begging you not to."
Not Recommended,worst fifa game i ever seen terrible gameplay issues with pass goes in wrong dirrection . script in ultimate team matches gk are f useless cant even save one shot . not recommend to get this garbage even in sales didnt deserve ur money/time
Recommended,"I only got this game because of the career mode (manager career to be specific), so I'm only reviewing what that's like. This year I personally think that the manager career mode is one of the best experiences we've had with the FIFA/FC games for quite a while now. I really like how tactics seem to matter more now than what they might have done in previous titles. There are quite a few new features that I appreciate, such as the improved youth academy that allows you to play youth tournaments with them, although I wish it had a bit more ""depth"" to it. The social media feature is nice, but really it's just sort of a remake of the news feed you'd get in the previous games. The gameplay seems more akin to the sort of football you'd see being played in real life which I find quite nice. I really wish EA would add the ability to view results from past seasons (all of the leagues, top goalscorers etc.). Also the constant copy paste cutscenes get old really quick, there definitely needs to be more variety with them. I would also like for them to bring more customization abilities for your custom stadiums. I think there also needs to be a purpose for earning money as a manager, because you do get a salary, but there is absolutely nothing you can do with it. Regardless though, I can recommend this game for those who like football and feel like managing their own club is something they want to do."
Not Recommended,"Bugs, lags, toxic people. Bugs: Interesting to see the exact same bugs from FC 24, not surprised though. The list is too long. UI not responsive sometimes (gets worse the longer you play), can also freeze the game often UI glicthing out the whole time (only restart is helping) Social Menu most of the time not working (can also glitch ingame so if you press R2 e.g. for Spring, Socoal menu is opening) People: Still the same toxic people but now with Rush, thats where people show their real character. Ruining the game for other people while beeing afk and doing nothing. Those people would not do it with friends, because ""they know you"" and they can have an opinion about you then, but with random people,...? Thats how people act today. Pathetic. Go ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ypurself!!! Game: Am i suprised? Not really. I started to play with FIFA International Soccer and played every game until 2020, Then is topped, because i was sick of it. So 3 years later i gave FC24 a try and now FC25. Also because i love football and there is not really an alternative. So what do i expect? Also, nothing...more cards, more cash for EA from UT. Cheers. Ps: I have almost 300 hours on EA APP before i had it on Steam."
Not Recommended,"BEWARE!! The input lag is disgusting. I've tested both online and offline play vs Console performance and it's so bad on PC. I have a great PC and can run this in high FPS but there's certain time in a game when the FPS just drops no matter if you're on the lowest setting. it drops when the camera changes (goal kick, corner etc.) to the point where you won't be able to pull off dribbling or green timing. The worst thing is just the general input lag compared to console."
Not Recommended,"Instant uninstall, what a terrible game. Played Fifa my whole life and it seems to be getting worse and worse. Seriously money hungry packs straight away? In game is laggy af and i have a good pc and you need to change settings to fix it. Do not buy, don't be addicted. Please don't give EA sports money."
Not Recommended,"Its FC 24 but slightly better. There's not as many hackers as people claim there are there is just a lot of glitches people use to win. Career mode is good and an improvement. Not worth 70, buy it on sale. On sale i'd recommend if you like career mode 70 is an abysmal price for basically FC 24 with extra game types For 70 I can't justify a recommendation for anyone to buy"
Not Recommended,"Played since day one. Game was ok. Each new patch, F**KS the gane in a new way. Long story short its allmost April an the game is so F***ED UP in every possible way. Don't get me wrong. Its not i cant win. It is that every player is forced to adapt in a cetrain playstyle(full aggressive, ridiculously high defensive line etc). And this has killed all the fun by killing the the unique and imaginative play style of each player"
Not Recommended,"I know EA gets a lot of hate, but personally, I don't think it gets enough."
Not Recommended,"I have to give it to EA for going above an beyond in creating an even more dawgshit game then last years and for me being an absolute tard donkey and buying it thinking it would be different. Go ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yourself EA, truly from the bottom of my heart, end yourself. >.<"
Not Recommended,This game is literally unplayable. Playing single player and multiplayer are completely different experiences. Multiplayer is extremely laggy with a lot of delay. There are times when I pass the ball and my player just keeps running in a straight line out of my control. I can't move my player so I have to pass the ball to break that bug. There are times where the game starts and I can't control my own team and the servers make me forfeit for being innactive when it wouldn't even let me play the game. I am beyond dissapointed. I loved this game for a long time. This is the first year where I am just not gonna play it because I literally can't. Time to move on.
Not Recommended,"This game is a complete fail. Poor optimization, huge input lag. The menu is bugged so much that sometimes i need to restart the game because of that. This is the worst EA FC/FIFA game i ever played. We all criticized FC 24, but compared to this.. that game is waaaaay better. Sorry EA, but i didn't pay 100 euro to become a tester for your in-game bugs. You have billions as a company, you have employees to do the job, yet you release an unfinished product. I'm not spending my free and limited time to polish your games with my feedback. Steam didn't want to refund my game because i played over 2 hours. I spent FP points too, i don't care. i wanted my money back because i feel scammed. I wanted a great experience, yet i received a complete dissapointment. My nerves don't deserve to be pushed by trying to have fun in this ""game"". FIFA died with the creation of ""EA FC"". This game is a joke for this community."
Not Recommended,"I gave EA FC a chance after I had a good fun with former opuses but OH MY GOD I should be refunded half the price of the game because I played half a game, HOW IN 2024 and NOW IN 2025 a studio like EA cannot make a game on PC. It is SHAMEFUL that I cannot play this game with decent playability, stutters, fps cap in gameplay, freeze, input delay... how is it even possible still 6 months after the release to have issues that should fixed in day one patches People have to go in their graphic card settings, in the Setup.ini, deep in the configs on their machines to just BARELY have a playable game, it is crazy. I tried, I really wanted to enjoy playing a football game but all I got is a game that is playable, it took me way too long to figure this out, but it is only because I paid for this game and didn't want to play the free one. Shameful, but it will never stop them, I hate it here"
Not Recommended,"*Career mode player only! Absolutely terrible, They haven't fixed the mouse cursor from resetting what's highlighted and this is an issue from at least Fifa 23. They don't allow you to change composure and defensive awareness when making a created player. The player customisation is bizarre everything looks uncanny. Even on lowest settings the game struggles to render smoothly. People that bend over and accept this are the reason we wont have a quality football game ever again, unless someone who cares makes one. My money is waiting for you"
Not Recommended,"This game is incredably pay to win. Unfortunately most times you will be playing against a pay-to-winner. The disadvantage in this game is crazy you can't take ball from a pay-to-winner's player, they are faster, goalkeeper has better reactions, and you are just bound to lose. No skill involved in this game. Do not buy it because you will be forced to pay just to be equal with most of your opponents. Pathetic"
Recommended,"As someone who plays career mode frequently, I really appreciate the game's realistic structure. However, the various issues with the PC version can be frustrating. For instance, the game often doesn't start, and I have to restart EA anticheat. I believe optimization problems like these shouldn't exist, as they are a crucial factor."
Not Recommended,"game is very buggy. in career mode, during half time, the game wont let me complete the second half. there are other instances of where the loading screen freezes so my match game progress is reset. overall this game is a waste of time. you can't even score with headers which is stupid."
Recommended,"In my lifetime I have done some bad things. As part of self punishment I play EA Sports FC 25. I already feel like a changed man, this game puts into perspective how even game developers can do bad things like releasing this garbage game. Highly recommend if you are considering self harm at any point in your life, 10/10"
