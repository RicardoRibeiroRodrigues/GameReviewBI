Recommendation,Review,Helpful
Not Recommended,"TL:DR - This game is a psychologically manipulative Skinner box. It is designed to be addictive, and to get as much money out of you as possible. Scripting, implemented to encourage FUT players to spend more money, is in every mode and makes every game an unsatisfying and empty experience. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, the income-focused manipulation displayed here is repugnant. DDA (dynamic difficulty adjustment) or scipting is just ridiculous now. In games against EA's garbage AI, if the game wants your opponent to score, they'll respond to your controller inputs instantly, not the actions of the player you're controlling. Easy tackles with world class defenders will either miss, bounce the ball to another opponent, just outright phase through the ball or even the damn player! Your keeper will do a Matrix-esque dodge of a shot coming directly at them or will spill an easy catch directly into their striker. The most outrageous though, is player switching on loose balls and when contesting headers. The game will sometimes prevent you from switching to a player (even manually with the right stick) if they're close enough to win a loose ball or are in the best position to win a header. They will instead just stand there, staring blankly into the distance, until the opponent wins back possession. It's the most obvious example of the game cheating to achieve the outcome it wants. This stuff is so obvious that I've been able to predict when a goal is coming, just by how many advantages the AI gets. Other examples: - 30 year old fullback with 60 pace will gain an otherworldly burst of speed to get ahead of my winger with 90 pace - Players will frequently and deliberately place themselves in a position to lose headers, even if you're instructing them to do the opposite - Opposition defenders will basically teleport to tackle you the second you press shoot in the box - Your passes will frequently go to a player in the complete opposite direction to the one you've commanded - Uncontrolled defenders will randomly clatter someone in the box, giving away a penalty - Some of the AI's most outrageous Sunday league fouls just won't be given - If the game doesn't want you to score anymore (or has the scoreline it wants to achieve), the opposition will just pass the ball around the back or run all the way back to the keeper upon any pressure. This would be fine if they weren't 2-1 down at 70', where any team would be pushing hard for an equaliser. Again, just breaks the immersion. - If the game wants you to score, all of these advantages are removed and opposing players lose 50 IQ points. It's ridiculously transparent. These problems extend to all other game modes, especially Ultimate Team. At the end of the day, all this does is damage the experience. Wins don't feel earned, since it's obvious that the game is allowing you to win. When you lose it's often because of the above advantages, not from been legitimately outplayed. For a game that aims to recreate football, it fails spectacularly in presenting the core part of that experience; the in-match gameplay. Neglecting this, by adding a scripting or variable difficulty system to psychologically manipulate FUT players to spend more money, not only irrevocably destroys the experience in all modes, but is also outrageously anti-consumer. I knew on reputation that EA Sports games were microtransaction ridden hellholes but this is predatory to a degree I've never seen before. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, manipulation like this is repugnant. Honestly, I feel dirty having spent money on this. Do not buy this or any other EA Sports Skinner box, it's a prime example of everything wrong with this heinous company.",799

Not Recommended,"I purchased this game 2 weeks ago and I still was not able to play a single smooth game because of the terrible otimization this game has and not only for me but multiple PC players, there is a whole EA forum dedicated to this error with over 300 pages and EA didn't give a damn about it and most likely wont fix. Its a completly incompetent company that doesn't care about their own playerbase, the minimum they could do is refund 70‚Ç¨ to all the users wich have been having this problem for over a whole month.",436
Not Recommended,"Even iPhone 16 got a bigger upgrade than the FC 25 but here are some things you should know before buying: 1, The game itself is not bad, better control, and no more feeling like you're skiing on grass. 2, Thousands of tiny, funny bugs, but it won't ruin your day.... mostly. 3, Surprisingly the Rush mode is pretty funny. 4, many new ideas for manager mode but the disgusting simplified UI is so bad to use (my opinion). 5, Prematch animation is back. Unless you play UT mode, DON'T BUY THIS GAME NOW! There are so many bugs! Wait for Black Friday or Christmas‚Äîyour wallet will THANK YOU. It's not worth paying full price just to fill EA's bottomless pit of greed!",500
Not Recommended,"I have never posted a review ever in my life. HOWEVER, the GARBAGE, BROKEN, and UNPLAYABLE nature of this game has prompted this review. I have played every FIFA/EA game since 2014 and have had seen some good games and mediocre ones. However, I thought that EAFC 24 was the worst in the entire series...UNTIL THIS GAME. At launch, clubs was unplayable. Every patch promised fixes, but with every update a million and one more bugs, crashes, and exploits appeared. Ultimate team is not any better, with constant crashes and unbalanced matchmaking. And now at the end of its life, the devs have become money hungry and have even added a paid version of the battle pass. At this point, it is literally unplayable with bots and AI directly disobeying commands and tactics. If you enjoy the series, do yourself a favor and wait for the next iteration. This is NOT WORTH IT.",247
Not Recommended,"As an avid fan of the franchise, it pains me to write this review for FC 25, which has delivered an immensely disappointing and frustrating experience. The most glaring issue is the abysmal gameplay balance, which feels more like a step backward than an improvement. Matches are too often decided by glaring AI inconsistencies, making even basic mechanics feel random and unreliable. It‚Äôs genuinely astonishing how unrefined the game feels after years of supposed advancements. Moreover, it's hard to ignore the evident lack of regard from EA for the game's current state. Community feedback seems disregarded entirely, with players voicing frustrations about bugs, balancing issues, and broken mechanics that have yet to be addressed. While cosmetic updates and monetization strategies are regularly prioritized, essential gameplay fixes are blatantly neglected, leaving the core experience in a poor state. In its current form, FC 25 feels less like a polished soccer simulation and more like a cash grab, relying on fans‚Äô loyalty without showing any commitment to improving the player experience. For a company as established as EA, it‚Äôs disappointing to see the community treated with such disregard, and the product itself left in such a poor state.",243

Not Recommended,"This is the worst, most pathetic dumpster fire game ever out by any developer. In every aspect. Game play is slow and clunky no matter what you do with the sliders. Your players cant sprint. It's like the game completely ignores your sprint inputs more than half the time. As the difficulty increases the opposing AI doesn't get better, YOUR OWN TEAM GETS WORSE. More and more passes get misplaced, more tackles get missed and positioning ends up looking like a squad of lazy kids who have never kicked a football in their life. Also the UI a terrible unorganized redundant puddle of cat piss. The bar with FC 24 was already low, and somehow this installment is worse in every single aspect.",223
Not Recommended,"EA Sports FC 25 is an absolute letdown. After all the hype about breaking away from FIFA, I expected something fresh‚Äîsomething bold but nope! It‚Äôs the same old game with a new name slapped on the cover. The gameplay is still clunky, Career Mode is as boring as ever, and Ultimate Team is just a shameless cash grab, pushing microtransactions like they're going out of style. It‚Äôs like EA didn‚Äôt even try! The visuals barely improved, and the commentary makes me want to mute the game altogether. Honestly, if this is what EA thinks a ""new era"" looks like, they can keep it‚Äîbecause this is just FIFA 24.5 with extra disappointment.",247

Not Recommended,Product refunded This game is actually amazing! It gives you a really outer body experience. You literally set low expectations and buy it for the sake of just playing FIFA after missing out on so many years.. and your body simply reacts automatically after you play for about 15 mins.. it just reacts and leads you to the refund page! Truly amazing. An outer body experience!,227
Not Recommended,"A buggy mess after latest patch. Players disappear from the field in second half. Goal replay shows players standing up straight like NPCs. Match ended and game get stuck at loading screen. Tried many things, clear cache restart new career mode and couple match later same crap happen.

Edit:- Game work for couple matches before the stuck at another loading screen after match. UNISTALLED THE GAME, BYE BYE EAFC25!!!!",185
Not Recommended,"EA FC 25 offers the same gameplay as ever. However, the game quickly becomes an exhausting and frustrating experience. There is a constant need to grind to earn rewards during every event (which occurs every month) to keep your team updated and competitive. This turns the game into more of a chore than fun. The player's AI is horrible, leading to frustrating in-game experiences where your players constantly make inexplicable mistakes that leave you wondering how is it even happening.",169
Not Recommended,"The most trash game ever. Every single year, it's the same; in fact, it's worse. A lot of bugs and glitches‚Äîthe ball is always bouncing from the defender to the opponent's striker.

So, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price (the $70 price tag is simply outrageous for the amount of improvement this game has gotten since the last title).

I am a returning player from Fifa 23 adn I am shocked that how can they ruined it even further. EA does not care about the players, the only thing they care is that their pockets.",186
Not Recommended,"ULTIMATE TEAM? Again and again and again EA just make this game worse and worse every year adding more and more arcade mechanics that EA don't know how to add that end up breaking the game in multiple ways. The defensive AI is absolutely busted, in high end games good luck getting a goal that isn't scrappy. EA have actually no idea what real football looks like this game is embarrassing, I'm embarrassed that I actually buy this game and expect something decent in 2025. FUT Champs. As good as rewards are this year is is actually so difficult to get through 20 games of the way people play this year with 5 at the back and high defensive ai. Do not forget that EA's servers are ran by hampsters. Gameplay in the first week of weekend league for me is actually so bad I went outside after 4 games. How can EA put no effort into servers on a game that makes them so much money? it actually blows my mind. PAY 2 WIN: Do not buy unless you feel like spending thousands of dollars trying to keep up with the meta to be competative, or wasting thousands of hours and still not getting the best players in the game. Rush is kind of fun but tbh 3/4 games all 3 of my team mates are mouth breathing ball hogs that dont know where the pass button is on their controller. Its a waste of 10 minutes half the time. BUT WHEN YOU DO GET A GOOD GAME its actually fun. Other than that I can say EA have made the gameplay a little better overall if you plan to play not competative or a game that isnt dependant on their servers like manager or career modes. Theres a lot that can be worked that EA probably wont even look at. One last thing SWITCHING. If no one is talking about this... they should be. Its broken and doesnt work properly. Has def caused me to lose some goals. Overall would give this game a 4/10 - REVIEW UPDATE: 2025-05-09 I have continued to waste my time in this game and EA has only made it worse. As a FIFA expert and one that has played this game since 2002. This is by FAR the worst FIFA EVER, call yourself what you want FC, EA FC, W.E. you have made this year EA is a pile of hot garbage.",118

Not Recommended,"This game is incredably pay to win. Unfortunately most times you will be playing against a pay-to-winner. The disadvantage in this game is crazy you can't take ball from a pay-to-winner's player, they are faster, goalkeeper has better reactions, and you are just bound to lose. No skill involved in this game. Do not buy it because you will be forced to pay just to be equal with most of your opponents. Pathetic",126

Recommended,"I only got this game because of the career mode (manager career to be specific), so I'm only reviewing what that's like. This year I personally think that the manager career mode is one of the best experiences we've had with the FIFA/FC games for quite a while now. I really like how tactics seem to matter more now than what they might have done in previous titles. There are quite a few new features that I appreciate, such as the improved youth academy that allows you to play youth tournaments with them, although I wish it had a bit more ""depth"" to it. The social media feature is nice, but really it's just sort of a remake of the news feed you'd get in the previous games. The gameplay seems more akin to the sort of football you'd see being played in real life which I find quite nice. I really wish EA would add the ability to view results from past seasons (all of the leagues, top goalscorers etc.). Also the constant copy paste cutscenes get old really quick, there definitely needs to be more variety with them. I would also like for them to bring more customization abilities for your custom stadiums. I think there also needs to be a purpose for earning money as a manager, because you do get a salary, but there is absolutely nothing you can do with it. Regardless though, I can recommend this game for those who like football and feel like managing their own club is something they want to do.",169
Not Recommended,"Bugs, lags, toxic people. Bugs: Interesting to see the exact same bugs from FC 24, not surprised though. The list is too long. UI not responsive sometimes (gets worse the longer you play), can also freeze the game often UI glicthing out the whole time (only restart is helping) Social Menu most of the time not working (can also glitch ingame so if you press R2 e.g. for Spring, Socoal menu is opening) R2 for quicksubs is not working for at least 3 years if you have advanced defense activated Controller input in certain circumstances not registered Freeze, Lags, conenction losses, first two things started to happen again today...it was fine for some days,..lol.. People: Still the same toxic people but now with Rush, thats where people show their real character. Ruining the game for other people while beeing afk and doing nothing. Those people would not do it with friends, because ""they know you"" and they can have an opinion about you then, but with random people,...? Thats how people act today. Pathetic. Go ypurself!!! Game: Am i suprised? Not really. I started to play with FIFA International Soccer and played every game until 2020, Then is topped, because i was sick of it. So 3 years later i gave FC24 a try and now FC25. Also because i love football and there is not really an alternative. So what do i expect? Also, nothing...more cards, more cash for EA from UT. Cheers. Ps: I have almost 300 hours on EA APP before i had it on Steam.",104
Not Recommended,"BEWARE!! The input lag is disgusting. I've tested both online and offline play vs Console performance and it's so bad on PC. I have a great PC and can run this in high FPS but there's certain time in a game when the FPS just drops no matter if you're on the lowest setting. it drops when the camera changes (goal kick, corner etc.) to the point where you won't be able to pull off dribbling or green timing. The worst thing is just the general input lag compared to console.",86
Not Recommended,"Instant uninstall, what a terrible game. Played Fifa my whole life and it seems to be getting worse and worse. Seriously money hungry packs straight away?

Not Recommended,"Its FC 24 but slightly better. There's not as many hackers as people claim there are there is just a lot of glitches people use to win. Career mode is good and an improvement.

Not Recommended,This game is literally unplayable. Playing single player and multiplayer are completely different experiences. Multiplayer is extremely laggy with a lot of delay. There are times when I pass the ball and my player just keeps running in a straight line out of my control. I can't move my player so I have to pass the ball to break that bug. There are times where the game starts and I can't control my own team and the servers make me forfeit for being innactive when it wouldn't even let me play the game. I am beyond dissapointed.

Sorry EA, but i didn't pay 100 euro to become a tester for your in-game bugs. You have billions as a company, you have employees to do the job, yet you release an unfinished product. I'm not spending my free and limited time to polish your games with my feedback. Steam didn't want to refund my game because i played over 2 hours.

It is SHAMEFUL that I cannot play this game with decent playability, stutters, fps cap in gameplay, freeze, input delay... how is it even possible still 6 months after the release to have issues that should fixed in day one patches People have to go in their graphic card settings, in the Setup.ini, deep in the configs on their machines to just BARELY have a playable game, it is crazy.

Recommended,PSA: Posting this here so that people who are having controller bugs/issues can try this fix that has worked for me. I am currently using a PS5 controller. 1. Disable steam input for ALL controllers. Go to Steam > Settings > Controller > disable everything 2. Open the game through EA Play 3. Turn on the controller when you're on the initial screen (when you're choosing your profile) This is a temporary fix. EA needs to fix this. Hope this works for you! Cheers. I will update this review after a decent amount of game time. So far though the dribbling feels much more responsive than the last game.,193

The franchise is dead, hopefully someone comes up with a competitor for the career player base at some point in the future.",47
Recommended,"Only playing Career Modes, never bothered about their ONLINE modes. Honestly, alot of improvements done on gameplay. (Comparing with FIFA22) Animations for the gameplay is done better. Love the defending, timing is key. Effort done pretty well for Career Mode, though I would love if they added more scenarios for the POST-MATCH interviews. A much better game than the previous ones, the best version being FIFA 17 ~ 19, still. I'd recommend this, as there's not much competition for EAFC this year. However, AI is still, well, not as you would want it to be, but they're still pretty tough to play against at times. Just inconsistent. I kinda hate that cutscenes, interview, etc., animations, still retained much from the EAFC23 - 24. Lazy effort.",198

Not Recommended,"quite literally, no hyperbole, the worst football simulator of all time and a disgrace to be sold at the price it is. want to pass 5 yards? not allowed. want to make a tackle? unfortunately not, they can keep the ball. and on the off chance you do get the ball you are simply not allowed to clear it as it takes 5 eons for the defender to register that he has infact made the tackle. i pray, at the end of my bed, every night, for this scum company to be held accountable and for justice to be enacted upon this filth. please rot in the deepest parts of satans playground EA Sports",79
Not Recommended,you will not enjoy this if you dont like getting cuz you can dribble through but if you actually try to normally play and pass the game says no lets use all of diddys baby oil and make the ball untouchable and pass to the other team so if you have been to a diddy party or like wasting money then i recomend,83
Not Recommended,"From year to year, this game gets worse. In my opinion, the gameplay is terrible, but that's not even the worst part. The most frustrating thing is that this game was released just a few days ago, and yet the transfer market is already going crazy fast. It's almost impossible to play against anyone who doesn't have several 88+ rated cards. I've already returned the game. I strongly advise against buying it.",66

It is buggy, laggy and glitchy, all hallmarks of the FIFA franchise on PC. All the ""new"" features in career mode aren't all that, just re-skins essentially. Don't be fooled by the flashy videos auto-playing, it's not that good at all. DON'T BUY IT.",42
Recommended,"It's an improvement over the last couple of years that much is clear. The added youth tournaments are a really good idea in career mode and as always the presentation is really well done.

EA should be ashamed 74billion company with sped developers That have never watched a football match in their lifes",77

Recommended,only play player and manager career mode to keep yourself sane i enjoy the 5 minutes i spend with this game after waiting 20 minutes for it to boot up on my pc :D,44
Not Recommended,"Hmm, where should I begin? Normally, I don't write game reviews, but in the case of FC25, I couldn't resist. Is the gameplay smoother and more refined? Yes. Are there new game modes and features? Yes. Does it feel like a brand-new game? No. The updates feel more like a phone software upgrade‚Äîadding a new slide bar but not much more. I‚Äôve always wondered why EA doesn‚Äôt just make the game free-to-play and adopt a season pass system. That way, we could keep our players and the progress we've worked so hard (and spent so much money) on, instead of resetting everything to zero and charging another $100 for minimal improvements! Like PES, EA could easily make the game free and generate revenue through packs, season passes, and other in-game purchases. Just let us keep the players we've invested so much time and money into! But since I know EA won‚Äôt see this, and even if they did, they wouldn‚Äôt care, I can only hope that one day a more honest company will take notice and build a game that truly values its players.",85
Not Recommended,"I don't know how to say it but this is the most pathetic and completely disgusting game I have ever played. My initial thoughts on this before was maybe it's gonna be better than EA FC 24 but by the divine intervention of the gods themselves, EA has made it significantly worse in nearly every aspect. Why do I still have bugs from EA FC 24?? Just why?? Have you actually played your game??? Everything top to bottom is horrible apart from clubs(but that's only fun if you have people to play with, good luck if you're doing drop ins) The community itself is a trainwreck too, 2 parts of it specifically: 1. The people who keep buying these FC points and allow this game and gameplay to be horrible. 2. Who keeps buying FC Points!???!? Honestly don't know how these guys sit there and say they are proud of this game... Absolute delusion in it's finest. In summary dear reader: Search up the meme ""Our Expectations Were Low But Holy F***"" and this game embodies that meme to a tee. Wouldn't let my worst enemy play this game. I'll only stick to clubs but this game is just disappointing.",32
Not Recommended,"While this game looks great and fulfills the FIFA void in my soul, I've been having these same problems since the game came out. It will randomly crash when I skip a replay, the graphics glitch frequently, making it difficult to view players when looking through my club. The PC controls are literally impossible to use, and half of the time I'm forced to try and use them because the game won't recognize my controller. If you have any recommendations to help solve these issues I would be grateful to hear them. ALSO the game mode RUSH is great WHEN it lets you use your players, Right now the requirement is for your player to be from the Premier league which is very unfortunate for me because MY WHOLE TEAM IS LA LIGA AND SERIE A.",34

Not Recommended,"Not even the worst fifa, the worst video-game I have ever played. I played on both ps5 and pc this year. Both have been genuine messes. The game play is the worst it has ever been, being a clunky rebound fest. Passes dont go any-where close to where you want them, and switching to ai defenders does not even work half the time. The connection is also abysmal. On Pc, the gameplay is soooo much smoother than ps5 with ps5 being some of the slowest slow-mo gameplay ever. But even on pc, it is a choppy mess with terrible optimization. PLEASE PLAY ANOTHER GAME OR GET EA PASS AND DO THE TRIAL",85
Recommended,"Product received for free I'm back Just when I think it's over, a cool EA PR man provides ya slav boy with a review copy of EA Sports FC 25 (very tenk you for this) and I'm back at it again, grinding for some smexy cards and doing SBCs for fun. For my review, I'll only be talking about the changes to , cuz that's the mode I main. And like every year, there is good and bad, but so far, I really like how the gameplay feels, despite it being a tiny bit clunky. I'm in love with this year. Brainless pressure leaves gaps in your defense, as does using a midfielder while relying on the AI of your defenders to do the rest. Defending takes actual skill now. So, learn how to play, or heck, who am I to stop you from getting filled up if that is your kink? Also, you can commit an intentional foul (drag them to the ground), which, if used wisely, can zap the momentum from your opponent's attack. But we all know attack is more sexy, so is there any new additions? We got (didn't play the previous game, so it's new to me), a super skill-reliant gameplay mechanic, but if you spend some time learning how to use it, you may end up ripping defenses open like Indian food me. There's also , it's somewhere between manual and assisted, allowing more control over where you place your balls But delivering a precise pass in space or removing the cobwebs from the goal's corner aren't the only gameplay changes. , a staple of for years, were removed last year. Instead, we got . So far, I'm loving how they affect the gameplay in a more meaningful way than traits did. Each has two levels, base and gold, making the difference between a master header and an apprentice easily noticeable. PlayStyles just give players more personality and their strengths stood out more, at least to me. However, to me, the biggest improvement this year is . Now, you may say my IQ is that of a potato for playing this game year after year, but vodka is made from potatoes, so who is the real loser here? Anyway, FC IQ. This is just a fancy term for ‚Äîroles a player will perform on the pitch. How well, well, that depends on the familiarity the player has with the assigned role, either none, a + (master) and ++ (world-class). The concept is indeed amazing, but the execution bit lacking depth, for now at least. I still love what is here tho. Each role has pros and cons, affecting how the player acts on the pitch. I hope EA expand this system further, adding more options for players to use in making their team's tactics. Do note that This fixes the possibility that any player can play in any position/role without issue, and I love it. I'm tired of seeing out-of-position players perform as good as someone who has dedicated their whole career to that one spot. No, a LB with no experience playing at CB should not play excellent there. I'm currently rocking a sexy Yugoslavia team, with a sturdy 5 at-the-back, with fullbacks pushing up whenever the team goes into attack mode, providing great support on the wings. But I gotta talk about for short, a system It's yet another thing that was introduced in the previous entry, but I just now got to play with it. And my GOD!!! This is it! This is what people who don't want meta crap dreamed for. My Yugoslavia Elite dream is now possible, as EVOs released during the year will offer me a way to improve my non-meta players and maybe find some hidden gems. I've heard that compared to last year, EVO has improved, specifically the restrictions and requirements a bit more relaxed now, so that's nice. I've already boosted four different poor players to good card, all for FREE. One EVO required coins, so expect some in the future will too, but it also gave my Moro dude an insane stat boost and a ++ Role. But so far, I'm bricked anytime I see a new EVO. I hope they let us use an EVO more than once, or change our pick. EA, just make it fun, please. But what about the grind? Squad Battles only has 12 games, each half lasts 4 minutes (used to be 6), and the rewards are better too. Now, while I do like the changes to UT Champs, I can see why many don't. There are only 5 qualifying games, which is more punishing for less skilled players. IMO, they should keep the 15 games (went from 20 to 15) for the weekend league but up the qualification games to 10 like it was. As for Division Rivals, it also got some new/old changes. You now earn points for rewards, 15 for level 1 rewards and 45 for level 2 rewards. So, about 15 wins for best rewards a division offers. And they are much better now, considering from Div 4 onward for rank 2 each week you get a TOTW player. So, overall, I do like these grind overhauls. It doesn't feel too overwhelming anymore nor does my effort go unrewarded. And since there are more untradeable rewards now, EA finally gave us a way to store untradeable duplicates, say hello to Now we have a convenient way to store and use dupes in SBCs instead of pointlessly discarding them. The new mode is not my jam tho. It's basically Volta, a 5v5 game mode, where defense is only a suggestion and people don't seem to know that it allows you to pass the ball to others. So, I suggest playing with friends, not randos, will probably be more enjoyable. The mode does lack rewards and incentives for me to want to play it. Yeah, there are some objectives, but eh, not really worth the grind imo, maybe for an EVO or two? We shall see... Now a bit of complaining. The menus... The UI... The heck is this? It just feels weird to control, and I hope we see an improvement in the next game. This list-type menu just doesn't work, at least for me. Too much wasted action and it's unintuitive, simple as that. Before we had clear and easy to understand menus. But now, I guess minimalism and all that took their toll, because this is just bad UI and UX design. There are also some weird menu bugs too. I often got locked out of doing anything, the game just froze, and so on, so had to restart quite a bit. And the controller issues (see my guide below) that are still present since day 1 kinda gave many people a sour taste, especially those who bought the game for Early Access. So, yeah, that's all there is to say. I love the game, people who know me know this is my favorite game of all time. I'm not a super football nerd either, I just like doing the SBC stuff, playing with unique cards/teams, and the grind/gameplay loop is fun to me. Why? I dunno, I like to play with balls I guess. With all of that said, I'm gonna head off now‚Äîmy Yugoslavia brethren are calling. I reached Division 4, but the Oh, and I forgot to mention‚Äî I'm creaming! See ya, football cowboys! Title Update 2 fixed the controller issues for me. But if you still have issues, check out my guide with fixes, hope it can help:",65

Recommended,"Last FIFA I played was... 13 i think. Gameplay wise it is similar. Players move better, however sometimes when I do a through pass, the player just stops running which is irritating. Also defensive play can be weird (might be just me doing something wrong). Sometimes when I run with the ball and enemy wants to tackle me, they can teleport in order to get in the right distance. While when opponent runs with the ball and I tackle them, literally nothing happens, not even animation of the player being pushed. I'm treated as a weak gust of wind. Other than that, I mainly play Ultimate team. You earn very little in-game money. When I watched some streamers (previous FIFAs though) spend thousands $, open dozens of packs and get nothing worth it... yeah, building team is hard. Bug wise... gameplay seems fine, except the tackle thing. However I often get menu bugs - when switching tabs or after finish a match, the menus just don't load. I have background screen, music plays, I can open and close social menu, but nothing else.

Not Recommended,"This game is borderline unplayable. The Good: - The new game mode on UT, Rush is actually quite fun however, often there are people not playing which makes the game pointless - Gameplay is probably slightly better than last year - Career mode has finally seen a few changes, better but still nowhere near what it used to be The Bad: - Servers are atrocious, you get booted out frequently - Not sure whether a player count issue but the online experience I've had is awful, huge ping spikes every 30 seconds or so and my internet is not the issue (Avg 100 MBps Down, 35 Up, Ping between 10-60ms) - The game freezes incredibly often, I've had instances of the game crashing, restarting and it crashing within 30 seconds - EA being EA, vast majority of earnable rewards on UT are untradeable so if you want to make money from packs you have to pay for them All in all shocking state for a game to be released in, do not recommend you spend your money on it but hey, at least controllers work now on PC (as they should have from second 1 of release) Would I recommend the game, No. Will I be playing on and suffer, yes.",25
Recommended,"This year it can be seen that the game has been worked on more than in previous years, but there is still room for some upgrades. The graphics did not receive major upgrades, but the interface and the game this year were redesigned and modified almost completely. Career Manager is an almost completely changed mode. There are a lot of new things, including the academy, which, in my opinion, made it a bit better. There are no more 14-15-year-old bald children in the academy, you can play individually and give them a growth boost according to the results. Scouting in the career has also changed, having the option to see directly the price on the market and how much the player is paid without waiting to receive his scout. Very interesting thing about the weather, which can influence your game (I haven't managed to experience this thing yet). And there are several improvements that are worth trying for yourself. Ultimate team didn't really receive big upgrades, it's about a year like the other one where bugs like player boost and etc. have already been discovered. Teams can be grown unexpectedly quickly and with the passage of time the charm of the game will be lost. A very interesting thing about ultimate team is that it is no longer necessary to play only ultimate team in order to progress in the season pass, but you are forced to switch to another game mode, which diversifies things a bit more The new tactics system is simpler in my opinion and better explained than the other one. You have the definition written for each role. The Rush mode in ultimate team is a very toxic mode in which the teammates do not really prove that they have an IQ above 50 and it is a bit of a waste of time if you struggle to play alone without some friends. In conclusion, some things have changed completely, which is very good, some things have changed less, and some almost not at all. If EA would continue to make upgrades year after year as it did with this game, we would once again have a playable FIFA that we will all play with love (if they give a little more attention to the ultimate team as well)",26

Not Recommended,"I can‚Äôt even comprehend how bad a video game can be, so here are my thoughts (mostly about Ultimate Team) as a pros/cons list. CONS: -Nontent every day; I can‚Äôt remember the last time they added a quality SBC that wasn‚Äôt either overpriced or just down right bad. - ""Microtransactions"" - packs cost ‚Ç¨15-25 each; with new packs added daily, I assume that's what they call ‚Äúcontent.‚Äù - There‚Äôs always at least one AFK player in rush games, since it‚Äôs the quickest way to complete evolutions. You can‚Äôt do anything about it, so you just carry on, struggling against tryhards on the opposing team. I wonder if they‚Äôll ever add an option to kick AFK players. - There was no option to mute the commentator in Rush mode until they finally added it in a recent patch. - CPU defense is too strong. You‚Äôll end up passing the ball around for 10-15 minutes, hoping your opponent will get impatient and rush their defender so you can finally score. The same issue exists in Squad Battles‚Äîsometimes, you‚Äôll easily win on Legendary difficulty, while other times you‚Äôll struggle to score and lose. - ""Nonexistent"" DDA - Even if your opponent is down 0-5 at halftime, they still have a high chance of making a comeback. EA, of course, claims there‚Äôs no such thing as Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA). - Player intelligence is poor; 80% of passes go off-target, so you end up losing possession. The defensive and attacking AI is lacking as well. - The game demands a huge time commitment. For better rewards, you‚Äôll need to play 44 games a week (12 in Division Rivals, 15 in FUT Champions, 12 in Squad Battles, and 5 qualifiers), each lasting around 10 minutes. That‚Äôs 7 hours a week, which isn‚Äôt terrible, but realistically you‚Äôd need to play 20-25 games to achieve 12 wins in Division Rivals. While the rewards are better, they‚Äôre still not worth the time, which seems intended to push players toward store packs. - Many players do nothing but spam skill moves such as fake shots and roulettes, repeatedly losing possession. It‚Äôs repetitive and frustrating. - Running to the edge of the field, cutting back, and scoring is easy because the goalkeeper‚Äôs AI doesn‚Äôt react well. - The game crashes often after redeeming an SBC. - After every game, there‚Äôs a popup showing objective completion‚Äîeven when nothing was actually completed. - Sometimes, the playstyle+ icon turns into large white triangles covering the screen, which requires you to restart the game for them to disappear. - Inviting friends to a lobby is unreliable, as the overlay button frequently disappears, forcing you to restart the game. - Draft hasn‚Äôt been updated in eight years, and they haven‚Äôt even adjusted offline match length to match that with Squad Battles. - Lack of highly advertised cosmetic evos. PROS: - You can create good-looking players in Clubs mode. - Manager mode is relatively well-rounded and enjoyable. - Roles+ and Roles++ - Most Ultimate Team modes have updated rewards SUMMARY: While the gameplay feels smoother than in FC24, the experience remains disappointing, especially with the push for microtransactions. Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend buying the game or spending money on packs.",8
Not Recommended,". the pre release game play is absolutely . controller delay is intense and the inability to hold 120fps in an offline match is distasteful to anyone who payed extra to play this game early.

I‚Äôm still cringing at my decision, and honestly, I‚Äôll probably never forgive myself for falling for it. OOF.",10
Not Recommended,"Straight to the point, just don't buy this game I wish I didn't. I cannot put any other way, this is been by far the worst release of this series by miles. Granted all the other games had issues but it was tolerable. However, with the version of the game I would advise looking at UFL or Goals. The mechanics are clunky at best, the finishing is awful, passing is absolutely atrocious and the AI is just horrendous. The AI is probably the best defender in the game as it doesn't matter who you have the AI will be granted a speed boost, physicality boost and defensive boost but when attacking it seems to render itself inactive or possibly minimal use is more of an apt description due to the amount of times it moves players into an offside position when you are not asking for any runs to be made. The PC port is also extremely temperamental as it lags during games freezes causing you to forcefully close the game to restart it back up. I genuinely do not expect people to read this but this was primarily to vent my frustration at this unfinished product which shows where EA are going with this game. Unless the game improves over the next release this series will more than likely die out especially with other companies making games. Unless there is a vast improvement to the mechanics especially the passing,shooting and tackling. I hope EA don't go and do their usual backwards thinking and decide to make this even worse then it is now. EA just get actual game developers that understand gamers as the ones you have now surely do not",16

Not Recommended,"Sometimes I wonder about how stupid WE (you, reading this and I) are for paying for this game, year-in-year-out. This game is not only absolute dogsh*t, but the developers don't give a single f*ck about the players. First and foremost, I have been playing FIFA every single year since 2012 and this is by far the worst game ever created. Fortunately for me, I already knew it was going to be a big pile of sh*t after last years sh*tshow, so I was gifted this game. It's day one of this game and you cannot queue up with your friends and play ultimate team, or wait- I should say casino mode or Clubs. The only thing that could possible make the game fun (playing with your friends) doesn't work, from the get-go. Wait, I didn't even get started yet with the day 1 bugs, or features I should say. The controller you want to play with, oh yeah, throw that sh*t out of the windows because it doesn't connect to the game properly and your players start acting like Sleepy Joe once you switch to them. Above, I mentioned ""casino mode"". Lets talk about this. EA sports, as most of you reading this already know, is one of the most (if not the most) greedy companies on Earth. This game is literary a f*cking gambling game first, with gameplay the absolute last focus from the dev team. Don't believe me? Just look up how many countries in the world banned the ultimate team 'store' section. This year they changed the name of the mode from like 2015 called ""Volta"" to ""Rush"". That is it. Those are all of the changes. If it wasn't for my brother gifting me this game, there would be no f*cking way in hell I would pay for this game. I'd rather vote for Kamala Harris before I put a single penny in this game. I could keep going but frankly, i'm not going to waste more of my time writing a review for this pile of sh*t. Please, if this is the only sentence you read from this review of mine, DO NOT, under any circumstances pay for this game, not full price not even a dollar. It's dogwater. The managed to copy and paste the code from the previous year but somehow when they pasted it and renamed the 24 to 25 they completely f*cked it up (once again). I wanted to add something extra here for those of you that will take the time to read this. Seriously I want you to think about this- Who is really the stupid one here (EA or us?). I think its us, because we fall into this yearly trap of paying for this dogwater game, paying extra for their ultimate team casino opening packs and then complain about the game every single year. So we have to come together and stop paying for this sh*t. They are manipulating us, every. single. year. The community eats this sh*t up like they are going to change something and make the game better. But no. Every single year it gets worse and worse. I sit there sometimes and think to myself ""How can they make this game worse? How? its impossible, its already absolute dogsh*t in every single way"" and no, they somehow top it off every single year and make something worse.

Not Recommended,"For career mode/FC IQ tactics: DON'T buy this game as FC IQ sucks and worse than the previous custom tactics Pro: good marketing of the new FC IQ tactics FC IQ tactics might be good for those who are new to football (games) (because FC IQ over-simplifies tactics) Cons: actually MUCH LESS tactics custom options now with the strict IQ tactics First, FC IQ tactics does not mean you can set one formation during possession and another formation during defence, you can only have one formation for both possession and defence You can't adjust the position of any player (you can only use the preset formations which are limited in variety) If you want to play 433 with 2 CAM and 1 CDM? Sorry you can't as there are no 433 formations with this midfield combination If you want to make an asymmetric formation (like having a LW with a RM)? Sorry you can't as the preset formations provided are all symmetric and standard formations If you want to make adjustments during a match? Sorry you can't adjust the position of players (player positions cannot be adjusted (like making a CM to CAM when you are losing), only the very limited attacking instructions and overall formation can be changed If your defence is under great pressure? Sorry your LM/RM/CM/CAM won't help the defence and will stand still and watch the ball on the midfield as the IQ thinks the jobs of the midfield players are only for the midfield (no options on defending behaviours) If you are having a clear and potential chance of one-on-one opportunity? Sorry even if your CAM/CM is next to you, he may stand still as he belongs to the midfield) Inconsistent gameplay and possible scripting (I play 10 min half time, and I have experienced this frequently - during a match if I score, then the speed of the player movement and the ball, as well as the action of every player will be boosted suddenly, and my sliders will no longer apply, and the AI will pass the ball very quickly and score easily as your defenders will just stand still without tracing the attackers and your GK will just dive on the ground without saving it even it should be a easy save) Unfair game with the AI When the AI defends. for many teams, their midfielders and defenders will have a very compact defence shape (they may even get speed boost when they tackle you) But for your own team, only defenders are defending, even sometimes they just stand still and watch the ball (For attacking it is in similar scenario) (Kind of intentional design by the game) It is also easy to end up with abusing one-two through pass/dribbling as your players won't move(strikers frequently end up in stupid positions of the box like moving slowly far behind you/do't appear in empty space) I have also experienced a lot of bugs/crashes/screen freezes, especially in half time/between the end of a match and the start of the press conference that I cannot do anything but close the game directly and lose all the progress (I have no problems playing other AAA games in high settings) Disclaimer: I have tried and applied no sliders/preset in-game sliders provided and many popular sliders provided by online communities, and I have only played career mode games in legendary difficulty (I heard that world class might provide a more realistic experience but it is too easy for me to win), so what you might experience can be different FC IQ tactics is a good try/starting point in my opinion but too far from finished product which mimics realistic tactics in real life football",7

Not Recommended,"EAFC 25 is yet another yearly disappointment dressed up with flashy menus and half-baked promises. Despite all the marketing buzz about ‚Äúnext-gen realism‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity-driven improvements,‚Äù what we actually got is a glorified roster update sprinkled with broken mechanics and recycled animations. The gameplay still feels clunky and inconsistent. One moment your striker is gliding past defenders like prime Messi, the next he‚Äôs tripping over his own feet in front of an open net. Goalkeepers continue to defy logic‚Äîeither pulling off impossible saves or letting in goals you‚Äôd expect from a Sunday league match. Ultimate Team is as pay-to-win as ever.

Not Recommended,"What is there to say about the latest FIFA that hasn't already been said. I'll base my review on my experience with Career Mode only, as it has always been my only interest in the franchise. Having missed the last few installments, I'm disappointed to not see many changes from the last game I've played, '21. The game isn't really much different, but there are positives to the overall presentation. While I can't comment on the yearly visual upgrades and the overall changes to the game presentation, it does feel it's closer to a real football game than ever before. While graphically the engine feels a bit outdated in certain areas, the implementation of various scenes before games, the attention to detail that are present in the audio and video presentation of teams is top-notch. Most teams home ground do feel unique, having unique songs, chants, stadium presenters, mascots and the like. This happens in most top leagues and while they were present in previous games, they seem to be at an all time high quality wise. However, downsides also come with this approach, as you'll sometimes feel a bit disconnected from actual gameplay and will feel as there are way too many cutscenes and visual interruptions to properly play the game. There just seems to be a lot of fluff to cover up some gameplay holes that have not been fixed for years and have been overlooked once again. But I'll get to that. Visually, the game is impressive. Stadiums, crowds, pitches and replays looks awesome. They feel well connected and everything just seems to be visually pleasing both by individual elements, as well as the sum of their parts. It's a cohesive visual direction which suits the game greatly. Audio is a mixed bag however. While the sound making up the atmosphere is pretty great, with crowds and stadium cheers sounding great, stadium songs for certain clubs are greatly produced and even stadium announcers seem to talk more and have more information than you'd think they would in a videogame, other aspects are lacking. The sounds of a player kicking the ball, the goalkeeper saving a shot, or the ball hitting the post, just sound a bit dull and repetitive. They're also the ones we've known for years. And talking about repetitive, the commentators seem to be getting worse and worse as each new game in the series has launched. Gone are the days of Andy Watson and Ally McCoist. There just doesn't seem to ever be a sense of occasion or real excitement from the commentators. Their performance is bland, dull and repetitive. While other audio elements can shine, commentators have been so disappointing that I ended up turning them off. The music in the menus doesn't even deserve a mention, completely forgettable. Gameplay has always mattered the most. It also seems to be the one thing about the game that hasn't really changed much over the years. Can you really notice much change year-by-year? I can't, it just plays and feels like any other FIFA from the past few years. There are still things that don't really work. Headers are still extremely weak for instance. I can't, for the life of me, seem to be able to score from a cross. Ever. Passing has also not changed much. It's still imprecise, especially in tight areas. Players often feel clunky, they rarely seem to move as fast as AI players. They always stumble on the ball much more, they always feel like they're just missing a beat, a step behind. Passing can be frustrating, but not only because passing itself can feel cumbersome from the imprecise controls, but also because players you are trying to pass to almost never do what you'd expect them to do. If you're trying to pass to a player making a run, it will happen well too often for that player to stop his run and turn back, only to miss the ball because it runs too far and he turned back. The only reason you're passing to him in the first place is because he's making a run. But he just stops. There are situations where a player is coming towards you and you'll pass to where he will be by the time the ball reaches him, but he'll suddenly start running backwards, away from the ball, thus losing the ball and the AI intercepting. All these small moments, among various others, happen way too often to think passing actually works. It gets frustrating, considering the fact that this has been happening for years and not much has changed. The problem is caused mostly by the unpredictability of the player you are passing to, not the passing itself. Players just seem to have a mind of their own. Another issue that's been present for years has been the inability of your team to go forward. Players will stay close to you, fullbacks won't run forward and make runs, no matter what your tactics are. Counter attacks can sometimes work. Those are some of the greatest parts of the game, you can score by having three passes in total, from your own box to scoring a goal. But those moments happen too rarely, because most of the time, your players don't go forward, don't make runs (only forwards do), are always too close to the player with the ball. I feel there are too many issues similar to these that make the experience not worthwhile. I could go on about the offside still not working properly all the time or the way too often moments of the AI players and yours just bumping into eachother, with the AI always getting away with the ball in every situation. There are too many things that just don't work and haven't been addressed in years. Some things do work better than before. Defending has never felt better. DM's and CM's are vital in defending and I've never had as much fun defending in a FIFA game. Pressing is a mechanic that you will have to learn if you're not used to it, as it is key to successful defending. It's also neat that it works great and is dependable. The way in which you can force the AI into mistakes and block passing lanes has never felt so satisfying. Tackles also feel heavy and impactful. Shooting isn't half bad, it can feel imprecise at times, but feels improved and reliable in most situations. Free kicks are quite fun and corner kicks have never felt as precise. The game has too many elements to properly address in a short review like this. Overall, it feels lacking because it hasn't had a proper gameplay revamp in years. While the visual presentation is top notch, the gameplay is so subpar in comparison, that you'd think the game is 15 years older than it actually is. I wouldn't recommend the game unless at a steep discount. If you're a fan of the series and have played it annually, you know exactly what you're getting into. It's such a shame there is no real competition for the series anymore. Competition has always brought innovation, but as things stand, we'll be saying the same things about the next game in the series.",8

Recommended,"Disappointing Rehash with Few Innovations Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2/5) I had high hopes for EA Sports FC 25, but unfortunately, it feels like another lackluster iteration in the franchise.

Any advertised ‚Äúnew mechanics‚Äù or ‚Äúenhanced realism‚Äù are either too subtle to notice or don‚Äôt make a meaningful difference. Matches quickly become repetitive. Buggy Launch: The game has been plagued with bugs since day one. From players freezing mid-animation to bizarre physics glitches, the issues are far too frequent for a game at this price point. Ultimate Team Fatigue: Ultimate Team has become even more of a money grab. The reliance on microtransactions is infuriating. The grind for rewards is tedious unless you‚Äôre willing to spend extra cash, making the game feel unfair for non-paying players. Career Mode Neglect: Career mode is stale and outdated. Despite years of player feedback, EA hasn‚Äôt added the depth or features that fans have been asking for. It feels like an afterthought compared to the money-focused Ultimate Team. Recycled Content: The menus, graphics, and overall presentation look almost identical to previous entries. For a rebranded game, I expected much more effort in differentiating this installment. If EA Sports FC 25 is supposed to mark a ‚Äúnew era‚Äù after splitting from FIFA, they‚Äôve failed to deliver. Unless you‚Äôre a die-hard fan who absolutely needs the latest rosters, you‚Äôre better off sticking with an older version.",26

If you're a fan of defenders with 77 Pace casually outrunning your 99 Pace attacker like they're prime Usain Bolt, then congrats‚Äîthis is the game for you. üéâ Gameplay? It‚Äôs... diverse. In the sense that you never know whether your players will feel like elite athletes or like they just ran a marathon before kickoff. One game, your team is smooth, the next, your striker forgets how to shoot, your midfielders turn into traffic cones, and your goalkeeper suddenly remembers he's actually a hologram. But hey, EA‚Äôs got their priorities straight. Instead of fixing the gameplay, they focus on what's really important‚Äîsqueezing every last cent out of players. üí∏ Want a competitive team? Better have deep pockets because grinding is useless. SBC packs? Good luck, you're getting an 83-rated goalkeeper for the 15th time.

Recommended,"I see there's a lot of mixed reception from all sorts of fans and haters of this game. I won't go into too much detail into how it's changed from older FIFAs, but I'll tell you my 2 cents in a few short notes. - Compared to FC 24, this game runs MUCH better. No/far less stuttering. No crashes whatsoever in 70 hrs of gameplay. Much smoother experience. - Gameplay changes much more affected the Offline gamemodes. Online people are pretty upset, but as a Career mode player I like the realistic sliders as well as the role system. Just easier to set up the players to do what I want. AI is better imo - As a more ""realistic"" game fan, I appreciate the addition of the highlighter. I like to watch replays of nice goals in every angle possible, with different types of replay angles/cameras, and the game looks IMMACULATE when zooming in. Absolute kudos for that. To conclude, in 70 hrs, I'd say this game is an improvement to FC 24 if you like offline modes. ___ I would like to see more randomness in terms of player satisfaction, more career movement, and generally more Career mode features, like investing in stadiums, merch, sponsors, and generally more stuff regarding the club management (at least as an optional feature to toggle on) -> I think FIFA 10 had this at least for stadiums, so it's not a wholly new feature",8

Not Recommended,"The game just keeps getting worse every year, the band aid fix with Rush did not last very long. EA does not care about PC players simple as that. The biggest problem is that, EA still has not optimised its game for PC, it's just a direct copy and paste of EA FC 24 with optimisation issues. Instead of lag free gaming experience like its console counterpart, PC players seem to only be getting horrible experience with input lags, ping spikes (sometimes 1000ms spikes with game freezes), and screen tearing etc, and this only leads to unfair competitive advantage to console users. After testing out so many different optimisation settings e.g. Window Borderless, Full Screen, VSync On/Off, NVIDIA/AMD Control Panel Settings, you name it, the issue still persists. Nothing has changed since EA FC 24, even if you have a good spec, it does not make a difference, there is still so much optimisation issues. It's really hard to enjoy a game with so much issues. Like fair enough, if you play a game and you lose due to skill issue, but here, you are already losing before the skill issue comes to play. It's 2 v 1!",4
Not Recommended,this game is so bad...you cant win if you are good player game decides if you win or lose,5
Not Recommended,One of the worst football game ever made in a history 1. You will always end up conceding goal at 45th minute. 2.

Not Recommended,"I remember the exact moment that I fully realised how much money grabbing they wish to partake in. When they stopped people grinding SBCs from start. I used to do the nation & league SBC to get the free Rare Mega packs & then for each 1 of the 4 I'd do, I would make enough coins to do the next one, until I was able to get a half decent starter squad. Now they have made them untradeable & what's worse? They have done it with the bought packs too, so unless you spend almost double currency to get tradeable, making coins unless through matches is near impossible. The way they P2W is worse than any other game that is p2W, you know why? Because at least other p2w games are usually free & then the loot boxes are how the companies make an income, we literally have to pay almost ¬£90 (for ultimate), just for them to 1. Charge us to have a good team 2. Make pack weight more impossible every year by adding so much more crap 3. And make it so you can't even sell your players to progress... Then they just shut the game down after 12 months & make us all do it over again, EA FC is the definition of renting fun.",10

Not Recommended,"I've played this game a lot, mostly Ultimate Team. Squad Battles is okay, but some of the scripting on higher levels is ridiculous. I've played Rivals a lot, only Div 6, I'm not great at the game, yet I know when I'm better than the opposition player, they're predicatible, just run down the wings, then trick trick trick. Typical cr*p. So I'm thinking easy game, pass around them, get the openings, easy goals. But boy does this game script any fun out of football. If you've ever heard of the AI scripting in FC games (and Fifa before this) this has only gotten worse and worse. Basically, EA make money from people paying for FUT Coins. If, like me, you don't want to pay for FUT coins, just earn them in game, then you're not playing EA's game. So they script your players, even the one you're controlling, in certain games, where the opposition player has paid for all the top cards, and you're players play like 65/70 rated cards. I've got 88, 90 rated players, forwards missing shots for 6 yards, un-pressured, just the keeper to beat. Defenders never closing down players, just letting them run through. This game is rage inducing. I've played football games for the days on the SNES, Pro Evolution soccer, Fifa 9 upwards. This is the worst, most cynical game for forcing you to pay for in game micro-transactions I've come across. You essentially don't control your players, the AI scripts will for you, so they let who they think will spend the most money win. You're just hoping, when you start an ultimate team game, that the script is on your side that game. Basically gambling at this stage. Do yourself a favour. AVOID this game. I've wasted a lot of time in this game, hoping it would be like the football games a decade a go, where if you pass in a direction, the ball goes that way. If you run your player in a direction, they actually run that way, but this game takes that out of your hands and decides if it wants you to win or lose. It's not fun, you will rage, and it's supposed to be a fun video game where you test your skill at it against someone else. This won't let that happen, it will control it for you if the other players due a win, or has paid all the money for cards. AVOID EA AND ANY OF THEIR SPORTS GAMES",4

Third i think this is only for pc players, but the game stops for up to 5 seconds and randomly fast forwards.

Badges have been broken for more than 2 years now, menus are glitchy, settings are over complicated and difficult to maneuver. If you're going to make the same game over and over, it'd be nice to include some quality of life features, but EA will never prioritize actual improvements over the dozens of yearly promos featuring the same players every time.

Not Recommended,"This is by far the worst fifa game I have ever played. I've been playing since fifa 11. Arguably this might be the worst video game I have ever played in my life in any genre. Roblox has better soccer games than this . I am a division 3 and weekend league player in all previous fifas. I can not even make it out of division 6 and cannot qualify for the weekend at all. Before anyone says ""skill issue"" let me explain. The defenders in this game do not like to defend at all. I make a tackle and it falls straight to the attackers foot for a wide open goal. Sometimes my defenders just dont even move to play defense. Everytime I try to attack, the other teams defenders make a tackle and keep the ball for their team leaving my team wide open for a counter attack, that my defenders do not even go defend. Goalies are basically useless as they dont like to defend either. The only way you can win is if the game wants you to. Everytime I get a chance at goal, somehow the goalie saves my shots or they all hit the post. I use the same shot in every other fifa and have scored thousands of goals. The only way to win is if the game chooses to let you win, I have a good team yet way worse teams keep on my team. This game is and I wish someone would release a competitor soccer game that we can all switch to. Also the pack weight in ultimate is absolute . I would rather drag my balls through broken glass then play this ass game. DO NOT BUY this even if it goes on sale. Save yourself and your sanity.",12

The delay this year is actually mind blowing and the frame drops are outrageous. Stop adding new things and make your game optimized and playable.,5
Not Recommended,"I am glad I did the 10 hour free trial with EA Play, I saved myself $70 and my sanity. I have played FIFA since FIFA 13 and was a Ultimate Team simp. I took a break from the franchise approximately two years ago due to the scripting and inconsistent gameplay. THIS GAME IS TRASH. There are bugs and glitches, most disappointingly : UT games where my opponent and I are wearing the same uniforms ! How is that even still a thing with that adaptive uniform setting when you select your uniform. I played hoping all was well and thriving. It is still the same trash that made me leave the franchise. I hope I can spare some of you the headache of getting the game and soon regretting it. The scripting is still unreal and deeply annoys me as FIFA 13-FIFA 22 was my favorite part about video games. PLEASE DO NOT BUY/SUPPORT.",4
Not Recommended,"This game is way too buggy to be 80 dollars on initial release. Stutters, crashes, locked in certain screens, and other smaller tedious bugs that make the game unfun. What makes it strange is that at first it played relatively smooth but went downhill for some reason. Bugs aside, game-play has definitely been better in the previous FIFA/EAFC installments. long balls going to the moon even after only tapping it, headers are all over the place, players not playing the roles that they were commanded to, etc. Some player customization's are locked in certain modes and available in others. Add diversity to modes such as career mode by including said options (hats, hair, facial hair, whatever to make it more immersive). All these issues have been talked about many times, yet the devs either blissfully ignore it or don't care enough about to do anything. FIFA/EAFC has always had a high ceiling that unfortunately hasn't been fulfilled yet. Love this game and I've personally been trying to make it worthwhile, but it's long. Don't get the game until there's a huge sale.",5
